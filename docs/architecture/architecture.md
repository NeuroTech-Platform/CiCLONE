## Key Design Patterns

### 1. Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- **Perfect Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between data, business logic, and presentation
- **Type-Safe Interfaces**: Protocol-based contracts eliminate interface ambiguity
- **Service Layer Abstraction**: Clean UI and business logic separation
- **Loose Coupling**: Components communicate through well-defined interfaces
- **Comprehensive Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently with mock implementations

### 2. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- **Domain Layer**: Pure business entities without technical dependencies
- **Service Layer**: Business logic organized by functional domains
- **Clear Boundaries**: Technical concerns separated from business logic
- **Medical Domain Focus**: Architecture optimized for neurosurgical workflows

### 3. Observer Pattern
- Controllers observe model changes and update views accordingly
- Qt signals/slots for loose coupling between components
- Real-time validation feedback through signal-based communication

### 4. Strategy Pattern
- Different image processing operations implemented as separate functions
- Pluggable electrode types through definition files
- Configurable processing pipelines through YAML configuration

### 5. Service Layer Pattern
- **Dialog Service**: Centralized UI dialog management
- **View Delegate**: UI business logic abstraction
- **Processing Services**: External tool integration abstraction

## Data Flow

### Image Loading and Display
1. User selects image file in MainWindow or ImagesViewer
2. ImageController delegates to DialogService for file selection
3. ImageController.load_image() validates and delegates to ImageModel
4. ImageModel loads and processes NIFTI data via NiBabel
5. ImageController updates view through type-safe interface
6. Views refresh to display updated slices with overlay capabilities

### Advanced Image Overlay System
1. User clicks gear button next to image sliders
2. Popup menu displays with base/overlay image dropdowns
3. User selects base and overlay images with real-time preview
4. Opacity slider provides immediate feedback with percentage display
5. Eye icon toggles provide visibility control
6. All three views (axial, sagittal, coronal) update simultaneously
7. Overlay blending performed efficiently for smooth interaction

### Electrode Management with Validation
1. User creates electrode through ImagesViewer UI
2. ElectrodeController validates input and delegates to ElectrodeModel
3. ElectrodeModel stores electrode data with proper state management
4. ElectrodeController updates view through interface contract
5. User sets coordinates using push-button workflow (medical professional optimized)
6. CoordinateModel stores coordinate data with validation
7. Processing generates contact positions along electrode trajectory
8. Views refresh to display electrode contacts with visual feedback

### Form Validation with Feedback
1. User enters data in form fields
2. SubjectFormModel performs real-time validation
3. SubjectFormController coordinates validation state changes
4. Visual indicators (colored dots) provide immediate feedback:
   - **Red**: Validation errors requiring attention
   - **Orange**: Warnings or incomplete fields
   - **Green**: Valid, complete entries
5. Form state prevents submission until all validations pass
6. Professional, non-intrusive UX suitable for medical environments

### Processing Pipeline with Clean Termination
1. User selects subjects and stages in MainWindow
2. ProcessingController validates selection and starts ImageProcessingWorker
3. Worker executes in background thread with external tool integration
4. Processing services execute FSL/FreeSurfer operations with proper environment isolation
5. Progress updates sent to UI through Qt signals
6. User can cleanly stop processing with professional feedback (no message spam)
7. Results stored in subject directory structure with proper cleanup

## Dependency Management Strategy

### **Perfect Isolation Architecture**
CiCLONE implements a sophisticated dependency isolation strategy that eliminates version conflicts:

#### **FSL Integration**: Self-Contained Excellence
- **Discovery**: FSL tools are completely self-contained with all dependencies bundled
- **Implementation**: FSL works independently without requiring system-wide NumPy
- **Evidence**: `fsleyes --version` succeeds after removing system NumPy entirely
- **Benefit**: No version conflicts between FSL and project dependencies

#### **Project Dependencies**: Modern Python Stack
- **NumPy 2.x**: CiCLONE uses modern NumPy 2.x in isolated Poetry environment

## Development Guidelines for New Contributors

### Code Style and Conventions

1. **Follow PEP 8**: 4 spaces indentation, 79-character line limit
2. **Use Google-style docstrings**: Comprehensive documentation with type hints
3. **Qt6 naming conventions**: camelCase for Qt methods, snake_case for Python
4. **Type safety**: Use Protocol-based interfaces and comprehensive type hints
5. **MVC boundaries**: Maintain clear separation between models, views, and controllers

### Architecture Patterns to Follow

1. **Domain-Driven Design**: Keep business logic in domain entities
2. **Service Layer Pattern**: Use services for complex business operations
3. **Observer Pattern**: Leverage Qt signals/slots for loose coupling
4. **Interface Segregation**: Use Protocol-based interfaces for type safety
5. **Single Responsibility**: Each class/module should have one clear purpose

### File-Specific Guidelines

- **Domain objects**: Immutable value objects, no external dependencies
- **Services**: Single responsibility, dependency injection for testability
- **Controllers**: Coordinate only, delegate business logic to models/services
- **Models**: Manage state with Qt signals, thread-safe for shared access
- **UI components**: Focus on presentation, use layouts for responsive design

### Common Development Tasks

#### Adding a New UI Component
1. Create UI file in `forms/` using Qt Designer
2. Generate Python code: `pyuic6 forms/MyForm.ui -o forms/MyForm_ui.py`
3. Create view class in `ui/` inheriting from generated UI
4. Add interface methods to `interfaces/view_interfaces.py`
5. Create controller in `controllers/` to coordinate logic
6. Add model in `models/` for data management

#### Adding a New Processing Operation
1. Add operation function to `services/processing/operations.py`
2. Update configuration schema in `config/config.yaml`
3. Add operation to pipeline in `services/processing/stages.py`
4. Test with both GUI and CLI interfaces

#### Adding New External Tool Integration
1. Add tool configuration to `services/processing/tool_config.py`
2. Create operation functions in `services/processing/operations.py`
3. Ensure proper error handling and validation
4. Test dependency isolation (tools should be self-contained)

### Testing Strategy

**Note**: No specific test framework is currently configured. When adding tests:

1. **Check with maintainers** for preferred testing approach
2. **Use Protocol interfaces** for easy mocking
3. **Test business logic** in domain and service layers
4. **Mock external dependencies** (FSL, FreeSurfer, etc.)
5. **Test UI interactions** through controller interfaces

### Debugging and Development

1. **Use Qt Creator** for UI debugging and design
2. **Check logs** in processing output for external tool issues
3. **Use Python debugger** for business logic issues
4. **Test with real medical data** to ensure compatibility
5. **Verify cross-platform compatibility** when making system calls

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't mix UI and business logic** - use the service layer
2. **Don't create direct dependencies** between views and models
3. **Don't assume external tools are available** - add proper error handling
4. **Don't modify domain objects** - they should be immutable
5. **Don't ignore Qt signals** - they're essential for MVC communication

### External Tool Integration Notes

- **FSL**: Self-contained, no system dependencies required
- **FreeSurfer**: Bundled dependencies, use provided environment
- **File formats**: Support NIFTI (.nii, .nii.gz) and 3D Slicer JSON
- **Paths**: Use pathlib.Path for cross-platform compatibility
