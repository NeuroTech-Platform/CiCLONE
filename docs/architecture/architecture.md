- **Comprehensive Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently with mock implementations

### 2. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- **Domain Layer**: Pure business entities without technical dependencies
- **Service Layer**: Business logic organized by functional domains
- **Clear Boundaries**: Technical concerns separated from business logic
- **Medical Domain Focus**: Architecture optimized for neurosurgical workflows

### 3. Observer Pattern

- Qt signals/slots for loose coupling between components
- Real-time validation feedback through signal-based communication

### 4. Strategy Pattern
- Different image processing operations implemented as separate functions
- Pluggable electrode types through definition files
- Configurable processing pipelines through YAML configuration

### 5. Service Layer Pattern ✨ **NEW**
- **Dialog Service**: Centralized UI dialog management
- **View Delegate**: UI business logic abstraction
- **Processing Services**: External tool integration abstraction

## Data Flow

### Image Loading and Display
1. User selects image file in MainWindow or ImagesViewer
2. ImageController delegates to DialogService for file selection
3. ImageController.load_image() validates and delegates to ImageModel
4. ImageModel loads and processes NIFTI data via NiBabel
5. ImageController updates view through type-safe interface
6. Views refresh to display updated slices with overlay capabilities

### Advanced Image Overlay System ✨ **NEW**
1. User clicks gear button (⚙) next to image sliders
2. Popup menu displays with base/overlay image dropdowns
3. User selects base and overlay images with real-time preview
4. Opacity slider provides immediate feedback with percentage display
5. Eye icon toggles provide visibility control
6. All three views (axial, sagittal, coronal) update simultaneously
7. Overlay blending performed efficiently for smooth interaction

### Electrode Management with Validation
1. User creates electrode through ImagesViewer UI
2. ElectrodeController validates input and delegates to ElectrodeModel
3. ElectrodeModel stores electrode data with proper state management
4. ElectrodeController updates view through interface contract
5. User sets coordinates using push-button workflow (medical professional optimized)
6. CoordinateModel stores coordinate data with validation
7. Processing generates contact positions along electrode trajectory
8. Views refresh to display electrode contacts with visual feedback

### Form Validation with Elegant Feedback ✨ **NEW**
1. User enters data in form fields
2. SubjectFormModel performs real-time validation
3. SubjectFormController coordinates validation state changes
4. Visual indicators (colored dots) provide immediate feedback:
   - **Red**: Validation errors requiring attention
   - **Orange**: Warnings or incomplete fields
   - **Green**: Valid, complete entries
5. Form state prevents submission until all validations pass
6. Professional, non-intrusive UX suitable for medical environments

### Processing Pipeline with Clean Termination ✅ **ENHANCED**
1. User selects subjects and stages in MainWindow
2. ProcessingController validates selection and starts ImageProcessingWorker
3. Worker executes in background thread with external tool integration
4. Processing services execute FSL/FreeSurfer operations with proper environment isolation
5. Progress updates sent to UI through Qt signals
6. User can cleanly stop processing with professional feedback (no message spam)
7. Results stored in subject directory structure with proper cleanup

## Dependency Management Strategy ✅ **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**
