# CiCLONE Active Context

## Current Branch: feat/UI

### **MAJOR MILESTONE: ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE + DEPENDENCY ISSUES RESOLVED** 🎉

The CiCLONE project has successfully completed all architectural goals and resolved critical dependency compatibility issues. The system is now **production-ready** with clean MVC architecture and stable external tool integration.

### **COMPLETED: 4-Step MVC Architecture Plan** ✅
> **ALL STEPS COMPLETE!** Full professional MVC architecture successfully implemented.

**Step 1** ✅ **Create Dialog Service Layer** - COMPLETED
- ✅ Created `ciclone/services/ui/dialog_service.py` 
- ✅ Removed ALL QMessageBox, QInputDialog, QFileDialog from controllers
- ✅ Clean MVC separation achieved for UI dialogs

**Step 2** ✅ **Refactor Controller UI Logic** - COMPLETED  
- ✅ Created `ciclone/services/ui/view_delegate.py`
- ✅ Moved file type checking, tree view operations from controllers
- ✅ Applied dialog service throughout controllers

**Step 3** ✅ **Create Form Data Model** - COMPLETED
- ✅ Created `ciclone/models/subject_form_model.py` with comprehensive validation
- ✅ Implemented real-time validation feedback and form state management  
- ✅ Created `ciclone/controllers/subject_form_controller.py` for form coordination
- ✅ Integrated with MainWindow for complete MVC form handling
- ✅ Added visual validation feedback with elegant indicators
- ✅ Enhanced UX with smart form reset and field dependencies

**Step 4** ✅ **Implement View Interfaces** - COMPLETED
- ✅ Created comprehensive view interfaces (`ciclone/interfaces/view_interfaces.py`)
- ✅ Implemented IMainView, IImageView, IViewer3D, IBaseView protocols
- ✅ Updated all view classes to implement interfaces with clear contracts
- ✅ Enhanced testability through mockable view interfaces
- ✅ Achieved complete MVC architecture with clean separation of concerns
- ✅ **FINAL TOUCH**: Elegant validation indicators with subtle colored dots

### **CRITICAL DISCOVERY: FSL Dependency Management** 🔍
**Latest Achievement**: Resolved NumPy 2.x compatibility issues with FSL integration

**Problem Discovered:**
- FSL was failing with NumPy 2.x compatibility errors
- Error: "A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in NumPy 2.2.3"

**Solution Implemented:**
- **FSL is completely self-contained** - bundles all its own dependencies
- **System-wide NumPy was causing conflicts** - removed system NumPy entirely
- **CiCLONE project uses NumPy 2.x** in isolated Poetry environment
- **Perfect isolation achieved** - no version conflicts between environments

**Evidence:**
```bash
# Before: FSL failed with NumPy 2.x errors
fsleyes --version  # Error: NumPy compatibility issues

# After removing system NumPy:
pip3 uninstall numpy  # Removed system-wide NumPy 2.2.3
fsleyes --version     # Success: fsleyes/FSLeyes version 1.13.0
```

**Key Learning**: FSL bundles its own NumPy-compatible dependencies and works perfectly when system NumPy doesn't interfere.

### **Current System Architecture: STABLE** ✅

**Dependencies Strategy:**
- **FSL**: Self-contained, no external NumPy dependencies needed
- **CiCLONE**: Uses NumPy 2.x in Poetry virtual environment (`numpy = "^2.2.0"`)
- **Perfect Isolation**: No conflicts between system tools and project dependencies

**MVC Architecture Status: PRODUCTION READY** 🚀
- Complete separation of concerns achieved
- Type-safe interfaces implemented
- Elegant validation system operational
- Advanced image overlay controls stable

### **LATEST ACHIEVEMENTS: CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED** ✅

#### **Electrode Positioning in Slicer** ✅ **MAJOR FIX COMPLETED**
**Problem Solved**: Electrodes were not centered around (0,0,0) when exported to 3D Slicer

**Root Cause**: NIFTI affine matrix transforms voxel coordinates to scanner space, where the image origin (0,0,0) may be far from the anatomical center.

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ **Image Center Calculation**: Added `get_image_center_physical()` method to calculate anatomical center
- ✅ **Center-Relative Export**: Modified Slicer export to subtract image center from coordinates
- ✅ **Coordinate System Integration**: Updated coordinate transformation pipeline for consistency
- ✅ **Documentation Updates**: Enhanced docstrings for coordinate transformation functions

**Files Modified**: `image_model.py`, `image_controller.py`, `slicer_file.py`, `ImagesViewer.py`, `operations.py`
**Impact**: **Electrodes now correctly centered around (0,0,0) in Slicer** while maintaining anatomical accuracy

#### **Enhanced MNI Registration Pipeline** ✅ **PIPELINE IMPROVEMENT**
**Enhancement**: Improved MNI registration workflow with brain extraction and proper template usage

**New Pipeline Steps**:
1. **Brain Extraction**: Extract brain from reference image using FSL BET (`extract_brain2`)
2. **MRI-to-MNI Registration**: Register brain-extracted reference to MNI brain template
3. **CT-to-MNI Registration**: Register CT to MNI space using appropriate templates

**Technical Updates**:
- ✅ **Template Selection**: Updated to use `MNI152_T1_2mm_brain.nii.gz` for brain registrations
- ✅ **Pipeline Configuration**: Enhanced `config.yaml` with brain extraction stage
- ✅ **Operation Functions**: Updated `register_mri_to_mni()` and `register_ct_to_mni()` functions
- ✅ **Output Management**: Added brain extraction outputs to stage management

**Files Modified**: `config.yaml`, `operations.py`
**Impact**: **More robust and accurate MNI registration** following best practices for neuroimaging pipelines

- **Solution**: Simple coordination with `QApplication.processEvents()` for clean message ordering

### **NumPy Compatibility Issue** ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Issue**: FSL tools failing with NumPy 2.x compatibility errors
- **Discovery**: FSL is self-contained and doesn't need system NumPy
- **Solution**: Removed system NumPy, kept NumPy 2.x in CiCLONE project
- **Result**: Perfect isolation and compatibility for both FSL and CiCLONE

## Current Status: **PRODUCTION READY** 🎯

### **Stability Achieved:**
- ✅ Complete MVC architecture
- ✅ All dependency conflicts resolved

## Current Development State

### Major UI Improvements in Progress

#### 1. Advanced Image Overlay System
**Location**: `ciclone/ui/ImagesViewer.py`

**New Features Implemented:**
- **Gear Button Controls**: Added gear (⚙) buttons next to each image slider for overlay controls
- **Two-Image Overlay System**: Base image + overlay image with opacity blending
- **Popup Menu Interface**: Rich overlay control panels with dropdowns and sliders
- **Real-time Opacity Control**: Vertical sliders with percentage feedback
- **Visibility Toggle Buttons**: Eye icons for show/hide individual images

**Technical Implementation:**
```python
def setup_image_opacity_controls(self):
    """Setup gear buttons near image sliders that open overlay control panels."""
    # Creates gear buttons for Axial, Sagittal, Coronal views
    # Each button opens a popup menu with overlay controls
    
def rebuild_all_overlay_menus(self):
    """Rebuild all overlay control menus with current two-image system."""
    # Dynamic menu generation based on loaded images
    # Base image + overlay image dropdown selection
    # Opacity slider with percentage display
```

**UI Enhancement Details:**
- **Dropdown Controls**: Separate base and overlay image selection
- **Opacity Feedback**: Real-time percentage display during slider adjustment
- **Synchronized Updates**: All views update simultaneously when overlay changes
- **State Management**: Proper handling of image loading/removal scenarios

#### 2. Improved Coordinate Setting Interface
**Recent Change**: Replace radio buttons with push buttons for coordinate setting

**Current Implementation:**
```python
# Push button approach for coordinate setting
self.SetEntryPushButton.clicked.connect(self.on_set_entry_clicked)
self.SetOutputPushButton.clicked.connect(self.on_set_output_clicked)

def on_set_entry_clicked(self):
    """Handle set entry button click for tip/proximal coordinates."""
    
def on_set_output_clicked(self):
    """Handle set output button click for end/distal coordinates."""
```

**Benefits:**
- More intuitive workflow for medical professionals
- Clear action-based interface vs. mode-based selection
- Immediate feedback when coordinates are set
- Reduced cognitive load during electrode placement

#### 3. Enhanced MVC Architecture Implementation
