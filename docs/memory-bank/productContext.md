# CiCLONE Product Context

## Problem Domain: Neurosurgical Electrode Localization

### The Medical Context
In neurosurgical procedures, particularly for epilepsy treatment and brain mapping, electrodes are implanted in precise locations within the brain. These electrodes serve multiple purposes:
- **Seizure localization** for epilepsy patients
- **Brain mapping** for functional studies
- **Therapeutic stimulation** for treatment

### Core Problem
Accurately determining the 3D coordinates of implanted electrodes is critical for:
1. **Clinical decision-making** - Understanding which brain regions are affected
2. **Treatment planning** - Determining optimal therapeutic approaches  
3. **Research analysis** - Correlating electrode data with anatomical locations
4. **Cross-study comparison** - Standardizing coordinates across different patients

### Current Challenges

#### Manual Processing Bottlenecks
- Traditional electrode localization requires extensive manual work
- Multiple software tools with complex workflows
- Time-intensive coordinate transformation processes
- Error-prone manual coordinate entry

#### Coordinate System Complexity
- Multiple coordinate systems (subject space, MNI space, Talairach space)
- Complex mathematical transformations between systems
- Risk of errors in manual coordinate conversion
- Difficulty standardizing across different imaging protocols

#### Integration Difficulties
- Fragmented workflow across multiple applications (3D Slicer, FSL, FreeSurfer)
- Manual file transfers and format conversions
- Inconsistent processing pipelines between users
- Lack of standardized electrode definition formats

#### Scalability Issues
- Processing individual subjects one at a time
- No batch processing capabilities for research studies
- Manual repetition of processing steps
- Difficulty maintaining consistent quality across large datasets
